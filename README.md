### Walktrough

After installing Npm, navigate with the terminal to the location where you stored our App.
### Starting the Back-end Api
Open a new terminal and navigate to the cd /RestFull directory.
Install the dependencies start the server. Make sure if you don not use the port 7000. If yes change it at server.js to a valid port. [1000-10000].
```sh
$ cd RestFull
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

### Starting the front-end

Now open a new terminal and navigate to the /EventManager directory and install Ionic. The -g means it is a global install. For Windowâ€™s it's recommended to open an Admin command prompt. For Mac/Linux, run the command with sudo.
```sh
$ cd ../EventManager
$ npm i -g ionic
$ npm i
$ ionic serve
```
After typing the command ionic serve a browser pop up should come. Now you can create a user and explore our app.
